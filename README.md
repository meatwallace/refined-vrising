# Refined PvP

V Rising Mod for the [Refined PvP](https://discord.gg/eu38292tvT) server(s).

This is not intended for general usage. It is an extremely simplified and streamlined version of some existing mods with tweaks and new custom behaviours for the latest iteration of the soul shards.

## Features

* Simple PvP kill feed
* Quick Soul Shard decay rate (4 hours)
* Blood bound helmets
* `.stash` command
* Admin commands to manage gated progression & misc tasks unavailable in default game
  * Boss (un)locking
  * Region (un)locking
  * Player renaming

## Attribution

I am not a C# developer nor game developer. Without the following projects & community, none of this would've been possible:

- [killfeed](https://github.com/decaprime/Killfeed)
- [KindredCommands](https://github.com/Odjit/KindredCommands)
- [V Rising Mod Community](https://discord.gg/v-rising-mod-community-978094827830915092)

I've included the license for [KindredCommands](https://github.com/Odjit/KindredCommands) specifically as I'm using quite a lot of that project's code for the admin commands.
